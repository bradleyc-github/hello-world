# hello-world
ideas, resources and discussions 
My name is Conor Bradley, and I am teaching myself how to code and learn different languages. My goals are to create projects that I am passionate about and that will help me learn while doing. Another goal is to learn enough to be hired based off some of the projects I have made.
